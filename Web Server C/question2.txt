Hello, Dr. Schaub,
	I wanted to explain the issues I had submitting Project 1 on time Saturday night. 
I began setting up for the project report about 10-15 minutes past 10. Up to this point, because of unstable Internet connection, I had worked on the project from my computer using the WSL. I had tested once on the AWS machine after finishing the 80 Level to make sure I could use the program on there, and it was fine that time. 
	However, that night when I went to compile it on the AWS machine, it did recognize the make command, even though I had already set up everything the last time I had used the machine. I spent the next 45 minutes to an hour trying to figure out what was wrong and fix it, but failed miserably. By that time it was too late to message you, and, since I was running out of time to complete the report, with 20 - 15 minutes to spare, I decided to run the tests using the WSL. After completing the tests, I proceeded to write the report, commit, and push. Only the internet decided to went out about 5 minutes till 12:00 and did not come back up until about 10 after. Afterward, I realized that in my franticness, I had only partially completed the pdf upload for the report, and so I had to do fix that and resubmit. 
	Would I then be allowed to use my late waiver on this project submission? It occurred to me last night, that I could probably have compiled the code on the WSL and run the executable the AWS. I am sorry that it did not occur to me then. Would you still want me to complete the report using the AWS instance?

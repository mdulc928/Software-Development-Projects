Notes about Project:

Things to check with error handling: 
	If I am correct, the thing I will need to watch most for is the I/O redirection stuff
	or at least on the most basic level, that is what I will need to be concerned with for this level CP. Continue working and testing with the different inputs that could be recieved.

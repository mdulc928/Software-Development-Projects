<h3>CpS 320 Lecture Notes</h3>
<h1>Threads</h1>
<hr>
<p>A <i>thread </i>is an independent path of execution through a
process. 
</p>
<p>Normally, a process has only one path of execution. The <strong>fork(2)</strong>
system call does <i>not</i> create an independent path of execution
in the <em>current </em>process, it creates a <em>new process </em>(new address
space) with its own separate path of execution.</p>
<p>Creating processes via <strong>fork(2)</strong> can be expensive. An alternative is
creating threads. We can create multiple threads running in a single
process, all sharing the process's memory space.</p>
<p>Interestingly, on a Linux system,
each thread is listed as a separate process in the process table, but
they all run in the same address space, sharing the same variables,
file streams, etc.<em><br>(This is a side-effect of the Linux kernel's internal 
architecture; it's a fascinating topic but a bit out of scope for us.)</em></p>
<p>To create a thread:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Declare a <strong>pthread_t</strong> variable to
	hold info about the thread<br>&nbsp; 
	</p>
	</li><li><p>Use <strong>pthread_create(3)</strong> to create a thread. Note that you must
	tell it what function you want the thread to begin executing, and
	provide an argument for the function. The function should be defined
	like this:<br><br><tt>void *dosomething(void *arg)<br><br></tt>The
	thread begins executing inside the function immediately (well, it <em>could</em> 
	start immediately as far as you can tell), and ends
	when the function returns.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>When the initial or "main" thread (the one that started when the program was
run) ends, the program ends, even if other threads are running.</p>
<p>Example: <span class="auto-style1">/home/cps320/examples/c/threads/hello.c</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Compiling Programs that Use Threads</h3>
<p>You must link with the pthread ("POSIX threading") library.&nbsp; Remember to 
put the library last in the sequence!</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<ul>
	<ul>
		<p><tt>gcc myprog.c -omyprog -lpthread</tt></p>
	</ul>
</ul>
<h2>Concurrency Control</h2>
<p>Since multiple threads run in the same address space, if they
attempt to access shared resources (such as global variables, file
descriptors, and dynamically allocated memory), data corruption or
incorrect computations can result if two threads attempt to access
the same resource at the same time. 
</p>
<p>To guard against this, you should create a <i>mutex</i> (mutual
exclusion lock) and have each thread lock it just before it attempts
to access the global variable, and release it after it's done. 
</p>
<p>To create a mutex:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Declare a shared variable of type
	<strong>pthread_mutex_t:<br></strong><br><tt>pthread_mutex_t mymutex; <br> </tt>
	</p>
	</li><li><p>Call <strong>pthread_mutex_init(3)</strong> to initialize the
	mutex:<br><br><tt>pthread_mutex_init(&amp;mymutex, NULL);</tt></p>
</li></ul>
<p>To use the mutex:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Just before you access the shared
	resource, lock the mutex:<br><br><tt>pthread_mutex_lock(&amp;mymutex);<br>&nbsp;</tt></p>
	</li><li><p>After you have finished accessing the shared resource, unlock
	the mutex to let other threads access it:<br><br><tt>pthread_mutex_unlock(&amp;mymutex);</tt></p>
</li></ul>
<p>Example: <span class="auto-style1">sharedbad.c, sharedok.c</span></p>
<p>Terminology:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>Any block of code that accesses a shared resource (global
	variable, globally allocated buffer, file, socket, etc.) and must
	therefore be executed by only one thread at a time is known as a
	<i>critical section</i>. 
	</p>
	</li><li><p style="font-style: normal">Failure to properly synchronize
	threads so that only one at a time executes in a critical section
	leads to a <i>race condition</i>, in which the outcome is
	nondeterministic – it depends on factors such as the order in
	which the threads arrive, how the execution of the instructions is
	interleaved, etc.<br>This is a <strong><em>VERY BAD THING</em></strong>.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Threads and Signals</h2>
<p>When a process has several threads running through it, and a
signal is sent to the process, which thread receives the signal and
runs the signal handler?</p>
<p>The answer to this question depends on a number of factors –
including what version of Linux / Unix you're using. The behavior
differs. Moral: <em><strong>read documentation for your system</strong></em>.</p>
<p><br><br>
</p>
<h2>Thread Safety</h2>
<p>A function is called <i>reentrant</i> or <i>"thread-safe"</i>
if it can be safely called by multiple threads at the same time.</p>
<p style="font-style: normal">In order to be thread-safe, a function
must either:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="font-style: normal">Use only local variables and
	parameters and call only thread-safe functions<br><br>or</p>
	</li><li><p style="font-style: normal">Perform locking with mutexes to
	protect its critical sections / calls to non thread-safe functions</p>
</li></ul>
<p><br><br>
</p>
<h3>Using Libraries in Multithreaded Apps</h3>
<ul>
	<li><p>Naturally, when writing multithreaded applications, you must
	take care that all functions you write are thread-safe. However, you
	must also ensure that all functions you call are thread-safe. If
	you're using a third-party library, check to make sure its functions
	are labeled "thread-safe" or "reentrant": if
	not, you will have to use mutexes to call those functions
	concurrently from multiple threads. 
	</p>
	</li><li><p>Most modern C library implementations provide thread-safe I/O and 
	memory allocation functions (e.g., printf, malloc), and syscalls are 
	generally threadsafe (although you may get weirdly interleaved I/O 
	operations if you have 2 threads using one file descriptor).&nbsp; But you 
	should check the documentation anyway!</p>
	</li><li><p>Some C library routines are inherently non thread-safe,
	because they store data in static buffers (e.g. strtok). Usually,
	thread-safe versions of these have been added (strtok_r) for use in
	multithreaded programs.</p>
	</li><li><p>Most C I/O functions (as well as I/O system calls) use the
	global <i>errno</i> variable to report specific error codes on
	failure. This would cause a big problem with multithreaded apps. All modern 
	C library implementations work around this problem by making <i>errno</i> a macro that returns a
	thread-local value, so each thread has its own copy.</p>
</li></ul>
